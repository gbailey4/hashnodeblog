## Svelte is Amazing!

As a hobbyist/learner my goal is to be productive quickly. To that end I've committed to learning only Javascript for a language. With Express and NodeJS I can handle the backend of a project. This is a well documented and easy to be productive environment. Alternatively, I can use NodeJS in Lambdas and other serverless technologies.

For the frontend, however, there are a number of great options. React is the major one with Vue high up there as well. I've tried both of these and have run into issues with both where I just couldn't grok the way that everything worked together. React felt like a lot of boilerplate for basic elements such as forms and state management. I actually enjoyed Vue but kept running into strange linting issues which were annoying to the point of me trying something else. Enter [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

I won't go in depth on Svelte but what I'll share the stated goal from their [Sapper](https://svelte.dev/blog/sapper-towards-the-ideal-web-app-framework) project (built on Svelte).

> Learning the entire framework in under an hour should be easy, and not just for experienced developers

That is the ideal goal for a project that I'm looking for! In practice, I've found this to be true as well. I was able to build an _extremely simple_ form app up in short order and begin understanding the ins and outs.

Another great part with Svelte is that when you have a question with the framework there is likely an answer within the Svelte REPL! That has been a lifesaver to get to know how to use it. For example, I had a question to handle clicks outside of an element in Svelte and found this REPL explaining exactly how to do it. This is even better than reading a forum or blog post even.

It's a very intuitive way to get to know the framework and figure out how things work. I've been using it on the side as I develop the frontend for [ePUB on Kindle](https://epubonkindle.com) and it's been a game changer.

Finally, it's great just how it's basically HTML and JS just with a little extra templating style functionality added. While I know that React and Vue can do this, I've just had a great time using and being productive with Svelte and I'd suggest more people try it out!
